# PluginAutoReload

This Hytale plugin automatically watches all mod directories for changes.
When a .jar file changes, it will try to find the corresponding mod (via inspecting the mod manifest) and reload it manually or restarting the server.

## Installation

Just put the file from the latest release into your `mods` directory.
